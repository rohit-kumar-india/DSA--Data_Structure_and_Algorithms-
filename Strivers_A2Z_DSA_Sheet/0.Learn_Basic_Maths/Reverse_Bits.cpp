Problem statement: There is a song concert going to happen in the city. The price of each ticket is equal to the number obtained after reversing the bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer ‘n’.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1 :
2
0
12
Sample Output 1:
 0
 805306368
Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case :
Since the given number N = 0 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000000 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 00000000000000000000000000000000 which is equal to 0 only. So the output is 0.     

For the second test case :
Since the given number N = 12 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000001100 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 0110000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 805306368 only. So the output is 805306368.
Sample Input 2 :
2
6
4
Sample Output 2 :
 1610612736
 536870912
Explanation For Sample Input 1 :
For the first test case :
Since the given number N = 6 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000110 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 01100000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 1610612736.

For the second test case :
Since the given number N = 4 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000100 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 0010000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 536870912 only.
Expected time complexity:
The expected time complexity is O(log(n)).
Constraints :
1 <= T <= 10
0 <= N <= 2^32

Time Limit: 1 sec
